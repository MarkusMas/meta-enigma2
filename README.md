# POWER ON and OFF
"Power ON" only works when the device is in Standby.\
"Power OFF" will put the device in Standby.

If you want to shut down the device completely in one occasion, use the shortcut "DEEP Standby" and then close the recipe as usual.\
If you want it to completely shutdown all the times when the recipe is closed, you can "Edit Power Off" and additionaly to the "Power Off" add "Deep Standby".\
Be aware that after execution of "Deep Standby" the device must first be turned on manually for using it again with your NEEO.

*Attention: the above was changed for Version 8 of this Driver. From this Verison onwards please make sure to use "Power OFF" in "Edit Power Off" of the recipe. (previously it was recommended to use the deprecated shortcut "POWER STANDBY")*
